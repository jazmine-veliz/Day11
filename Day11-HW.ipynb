    "**Q2 Answers:** I noticed that 4 out of the 7 departments had a higher percentage of women in comparison to men. These 4 departments were Department A, Department B, Department D, and Department F. Additionally, my numbers align with the visualization below perfectly because all of the percentages for each of the departments \"line-up\". For example, the 4 departments that had a higher percentage of women are displayed in the graph, even the amount by which the percentage leads. And the percentages of women that were lower in certain departments are also shown on the graphs."
